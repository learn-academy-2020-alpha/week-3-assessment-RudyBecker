# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring allows a programmer to shorten the writing of their code by taking its components and reassigning them to a shorter word.

  Researched answer: Destructuring assignment allows you to assign the properties of an array or object to variables using syntax that looks similar to array or object literals. This syntax can be extremely terse, while still exhibiting more clarity than the traditional property access.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: arrays, strings, objects

  Researched answer: Current Value, index, or array



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class you can pass state and props through, an object cannot be changed, all the parameters are already set. 

  Researched answer:
  
  A class is a blueprint from which you can create the instance, i.e., objects.	
  A class is used to bind data as well as methods together as a single unit.
  Classes have logical existence.
  A class doesn't take any memory spaces when a programmer creates one.
  The class has to be declared only once.
  
  An object is the instance of the class, which helps programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class.
	Object acts like a variable of the class.
	Objects have a physical existence.
	An object takes memory when a programmer creates one.
	Objects can be declared several times depending on the requirement.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: A div can be assigned css styling while a span cannot receive styling.

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line and used to group larger chunks of code.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer: Not sure.
  
  Researched answer: React fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM because fragments are not rendered to the DOM. So basically we use React.Fragment where we would normally use a wrapper div.

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: 1) adding a flex box, 2)editing media query settings 3) making text size dynamic (i.e. a percentage of display size)

  Researched answer: 
  
  Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

 The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.

- Instance variable : In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.

- Ruby hash : A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" = > "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.

The order in which you traverse a hash by either key or value may seem arbitrary and will generally not be in the insertion order. If you attempt to access a hash with a key that does not exist, the method will return nil.

- Class relationships: One of the advantages of Object-Oriented programming language is code reuse. This reusability is possible due to the relationship b/w the classes. Object oriented programming generally support 4 types of relationships that are: inheritance , association, composition and aggregation. All these relationship is based on "is a" relationship, "has-a" relationship and "part-of" relationship.
